While buying offers potential appreciation and tax benefits, renting provides flexibility and lower initial commitment. Based on our analysis, buying becomes financially advantageous if you plan to stay in the same location for at least 5-7 years and have stable income. However, the decision should ultimately align with your personal goals and circumstances. Consider consulting with financial advisors and real estate experts to make an informed decision based on your specific situation."
